          <h1>Hello & Welcome</h1>
          <br />
          <p class="paragraph">
            My name is Irina, and for the past 14 years I’ve dedicated my work
            to supporting children, teens, and families—especially those with
            autism, speech and language delays, and other developmental
            differences. My passion is helping children unlock their unique
            potential while giving parents the tools, strategies, and confidence
            to create nurturing environments at home.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            My journey began with a love for children and curiosity about the
            many ways they communicate with the world. That led me to earn a
            B.A. in Human Communication Disorders from California State
            University, Fullerton, and to train as a speech therapist. Along the
            way, I became a Registered Behavior Technician (RBT) with advanced
            training in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), giving me strong
            foundations in both evidence-based and holistic approaches.

        <div>
          <p class="paragraph">Over the years, I have worn many hats:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="paragraph">
              Speech and autism specialist in private homes, schools, and
              therapy centers.
            </li>
            <li class="paragraph">
              Parent coach guiding families in communication strategies,
              behavior support, and daily routines.
            </li>
            <li class="paragraph">
              Art therapy facilitator, helping children express themselves
              through creativity.
            </li>
            <li class="paragraph">
              Sound healing provider, using soothing frequencies and instruments
              to support sensory regulation and relaxation.
            </li>
            <li class="paragraph">
              Child care and developmental support provider, caring for infants
              through teens with diverse abilities.
            </li>
            <li class="paragraph">
              Bilingual tutor, teaching both English and Russian to children and
              families.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p class="paragraph">
            Each of these roles has strengthened my belief in a whole-child,
            whole-family approach. Children thrive when therapy is not only
            evidence-based but also joyful, creative, and respectful of their
            individuality. Parents thrive when they feel supported, understood,
            and equipped with practical tools that truly work in everyday life.
